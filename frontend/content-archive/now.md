This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/) where I write a bit about what I’m currently up to, both professionally and personally. Last updated on October 13, 2020.

## Tula Studio

Transitioning my freelancing business into a [digital agency](https://tulastudio.se/). It has a name, website and office. Even business cards. The work and clients remain the same, but having it more formalized makes for more exciting future prospects.

## Learning Italian

My fiancé is from Italy and it’s time to learn the langauge. I would like to fit in better when we’re there, have conversations with my future mother-in-law and eventually retire in Italy. After some time on Duolingo I’m now taking weekly classes. There is a lot to learn, but spending time in Italy is a big advantage.

## Fermentation

During my time working from home I have been getting into lacto-fermenation, which is a lovely low-effort hobby. Blueberries, chili peppers, plums, potatoes, cabbage, mustard seeds, pineapple, mango, grapes, bananas and carrots have all occupied the fermentation jars. I’d recommend [The Art of Fermentation](https://www.wildfermentation.com/the-art-of-fermentation/) for a great overview and [The Noma Guide to Fermentation](https://www.workman.com/products/the-noma-guide-to-fermentation) for inspiration and ideas.

## Music Production

As music is a big [interest of mine](https://www.last.fm/user/sidp), I have long wanted to learn how the sausage gets made. After creating a drum machine with the Web Audio API I started reading up on music theory. I already know a bit about Ableton Live since before but need to learn a lot more to put things together.
