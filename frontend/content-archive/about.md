I build things for people on the internet – and I love it! The past 15 years, I’ve created services that millions of people use, like and share. Currently running the small production company <a href="https://tulastudio.se/" target="_blank">Tula Studio</a> in Malmö, Sweden.

## Briefly about me

I combine expertise in web development and interaction design with communicative thinking and a strong design sense, creating understandable and efficient solutions for real people. While my profile is versatile and includes facilitating workshops, retouching images for ad campaigns and creating algorithms for [perfect matchmaking](/project/match-machine/), my strong suit is front-end development.

People say that I do have an eye for good typography and layout, probably inherited from my family. Despite my focus on digital production, I still think it is fun to work with print every now and then.

## Clients

I’ve been fortunate to work with Samsung, Telenor, Swedish Athletics Association, RES, Norrlandsoperan, Operation Smile, Logitech, Hemnet, Fastighetsbyrån, VikingLine, MTV, SVT, TV4, Coca-Cola, E.ON, Europcar, Unilever, VH1, etc.

## Everyday tech

HTML, CSS, PostCSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, WordPress, PHP, Python, Django, Express, Nginx, Apache, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Git and Linux (Ubuntu).
