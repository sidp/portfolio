I build things for people on the internet – and I love it! The past eleven years, I’ve created services that millions of people use, like and share.


## Briefly about me

I combine expertise in web development and interaction design with communicative thinking and a strong design sense, creating understandable and efficient solutions for real people. While my profile is versatile and includes facilitating workshops, retouching images for ad campaigns and creating algorithms for [perfect matchmaking](/project/match-machine/), my strong suit is front-end development.

People say that I do have an eye for good typography and layout, probably inherited from my family. Despite my focus on digital production, I still think it is fun to work with print every now and then.

After six years at my first job with communication agency [Stormen kommunikation](http://stormen.nu/), I joined [Wenderfalck](http://wenderfalck.com/) in March 2012.
