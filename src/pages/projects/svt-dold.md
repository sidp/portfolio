Har vi ditt lösenord? was a service to complement SVT Dold’s reportage on password security. Users could inquire whether their login details were part of the over 1 billion accounts that SVT compiled from data breaches. If the login details were found, the user could request an email with information about the hacked websites, and instructions on how to improve the user's password security.

## Results

2 million people (1/5 of the Swedish population) used the service during its 9 day campaign period. It was the main topic in the Swedish media on its launch day.

## My role and responsibility

I did the web development and was responsible for operations during the campaign. The service was built on Django.
