*Match Machine* was a Facebook app created to bring attention to the premiere of MTV’s dating show “Are You the One?”. Through a sophisticated algorithm, users could find out their perfect match among their Facebook friends. The results were good enough to achieve a conversion rate of 19 percent from visit to share, and Match Machine went viral.

The Match Machine had more than 48 million users between its launch in January 2014 until its end in May 2015, generated over one billion impressions on Facebook, and contributed to “Are You the One?” being renewed for another season.
