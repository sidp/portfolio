The website *Svenska löpare* gives access to all running races, trainings and events organized by the Swedish Athletic Association and its members. The goal of Svenska löpare is health promotion and social gathering through running.

My role in this project has been interaction design, front-end and back-end development, and project management. The project is ongoing and is being continuously developed.
