*Needs More JPEG* is a web service created as a reference to the "Needs More JPEG" internet meme. Upload your image, and the service will completely ruin it for you. Useless for sure, but roughly 25 000 people a month seem to like it. Can also be used through a Facebook Messenger bot. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/needs-more-jpeg
