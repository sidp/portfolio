Utmanare Redo (Contender Ready) was a campaign with the goal of attracting the fitness audience to the TV show Gladiatorerna (The Gladiators). We created a website where gladiators challenged the public in weekly fitness exercises. By accepting the challenge visitors could realize the level of fitness required of the gladiators, thus changing their opinion on them, from pure muscle mass to actual athletes.

## Results

The website attracted over 100,000 visitors with an average session duration of three minutes. The number of streams started on TV4 Play rose by 15% due to Utmanare Redo.

## My role and responsibility

I was on the creative team and responsible for the development of the website. The front-end is built with React. All animations are CSS based and the website relies heavily on the HTML5 video elements for visuals and gladiator challenges. The site runs on a PHP back-end developed by More Digital Studio.
