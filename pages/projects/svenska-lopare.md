The website Svenska löpare gives access to all running races, trainings and events organized by the Swedish Athletic Association and its members. The goal of Svenska löpare is health promotion and social gathering through running.

Svenska löpare is a long term project. It's now in its second year and we're seeing strong growth primarily from organic search. We're also rolling out a feature where race organizers can log in and customize their pages.

## Role and responsibility

I did the interaction design, web development, and some project management. Svenska löpare is built on WordPress. React is used for the more advanced front-end functionality.
