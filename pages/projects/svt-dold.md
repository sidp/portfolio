Har vi ditt lösenord? was a service to complement SVT Dold’s reportage on password security. Users could inquire whether their login details were part of the data breaches compiled by SVT. 2 million people used the service during its 9 day campaign period. I was responsible for web development as well as operations during the campaign.
