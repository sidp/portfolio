I build things for people on the internet. And I love it! As the Technical Director at the PR agency [Wenderfalck](http://wenderfalck.com/) in Stockholm, Sweden, I create services that millions of people use, like and share.


## Briefly about me

I have more than ten years of experience in web development, design and consulting. I combine production with communicative thinking and a strong design sense, creating understandable and efficient solutions for real people. While my role is versatile and includes organizing workshops with clients, retouching images for ad campaigns and creating algorithms for [perfect matchmaking](/project/match-machine/), etc, my strong suit is front-end development.

People say that I do have an eye for good typography and layout, probably inherited from my family. Despite my focus on digital production, I still think it is fun to work with print every now and then.

After six years at my first job with communication agency [Stormen kommunikation](http://stormen.nu/), I joined Wenderfalck in March 2012.
